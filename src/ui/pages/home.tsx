First, however, I want to finish the internal <Link to="equipment-editor">Equipment Editor</Link> so I can get the rest of the Clan and Inner Sphere weapons ready for the BattleMech creator.</p>

                      <p><strong>2021 Feb 18</strong> - Since there's still a pretty big gap in Alpha Strike Force creation and BattleMech creation on mobile devices, I've decided to reopen this app again. The official App is great, albeit slow, and doesn't do much for Alpha Strike folks.</p>
